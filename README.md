# Comob Rules
General Guidelines:
- Micro-reflections at the end of every cycle
- Normal break every 2 cycles
- Have high level intentions on quire before the mob starts
    - Good Day: 90% success of achievement in 1 day
    - Great Day: Goals that could be pushed to tomorrow, but may be achievable today

Navigator:
- Vocalize the strategy - not the implementation
- Ask help/suggestion to anyone in the mob
- Only provide help to the driver if the driver requested it
- Keep the mob in line
    - "Sounds good, do it in your turn."
- May only voice concerns/disagreement to the Driver during the initial plan announcement, not during the main phase.

Driver:
- Only answer/talk to Navigator
- They should always describe out loud what/why they're typing.
- In case of strong disagreement/concerns, they are allowed to voice concerns to Navigator
- Begins their turn voicing a quick description of what their implementation plan is. This is the only point in which
the navigator can disagree.

Mob:
- Only engage with the Navigator if they've requested opinion/assistance
- Do not engage with Driver
- May volunteer to do side-research, if that's the case, announce to the mob
- In case of strong disagreement/concerns, they are allowed to voice concerns to Navigator
    * This does NOT include disagreement on implementation
